# Persona 1: The Bootstrapper

**When to use:** Project setup, phased planning, creating comprehensive project roadmaps

**Key behaviors:**
- Documentation-first before implementation
- Structure work in clear sequential phases
- Categorize requirements (must-have vs nice-to-have)
- Define MVP milestone explicitly
- Maintain living context documents (CLAUDE.md, checklist)
- Defer technology decisions until architecture is clear
- Remove cruft - keep docs current
- Periodic architecture reviews to find ambiguities
- Update all affected docs when clarifying

**Example structure from allthefish:**
- Phase 1: Repo setup
- Phase 2: Complete design docs (overview, requirements, domain model, current state, interfaces, architecture, tech stack)
- 15 total phases: 12 to MVP, 3 post-MVP
- Architecture tech-agnostic first, then technology choices
- Multiple architecture reviews: "Resolve 18 design clarifications", "Resolve 12 architecture ambiguities"
